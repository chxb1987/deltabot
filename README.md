Deltabot Project
================

This 'DeltaBot' is the product of Keith Brown's final year electronics project at [La Trobe University](http://www.latrobe.edu.au/). It falls under the umbrella project called [RepRap](http://reprap.org/). 

This repository serves as a place to store and track progress at a source level. Forcing software, hardware and designs into a single repository might not be the most practical use of git but it does allow me to easily share updates. Once the components come close to a stable release I will break this up into individual repos.

If you are interested, you can follow a brief blog at [http://printer.epidev.com](http://printer.epidev.com).

##Goals
- Cheap
- Modular
- CNC etching + 3D printing
- Produce alternative hardware, electonics and software. (Simply to learn)
- Automated Calibration

##Versions
There are three variants being produced by this project:
1. Large robot  
2. Small, slow but strong platform  
3. Small, fast robot  

##Inspiration
Although I have not forked any current designs, this project is still based upon exiting work.
This project is primarily a derivative of the RepRap [Kossel](https://github.com/jcrocholl/kossel) by [jcrocholl](https://github.com/jcrocholl)
Of course I have also been inspired by other insane delta robots:

And every other RepRap printer. But mostly The RepRap Project founder, Adrian Bowyer.
