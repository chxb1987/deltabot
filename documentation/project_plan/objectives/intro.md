Project Objectives
==================

There are many components required to complete this project. To have a functioning 3D printer, it is essential that all primary objectives are completed. Secondary Objectives may be attempted if the primary goals have been satisfied before the development deadline. These potential tasks would greatly improve the final product. Finally, the tertiary objectives are considered not in the current project scope due to budget and time constraints. They are intented for future improvement.
