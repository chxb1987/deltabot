Budget
======

There are many consumer 3D printers on the market currently. They range from $450 to over $20,000. One of the primary goals of this project is to produce inexpensive electronics to help reduce the overall cost of 3D printing. $450 is very competitive if the quality is reasonable. The final target cost for this project is a base model for $300 AUD. I have considered many aspects that will help minimise costs:

- MSP430 value line microcontrollers
- Modular stackable mainboard
- Optional components: Flash memory, LCD and Ethernet.
- Minimal hardware
- Heavy gauge Fishing wire instead of typical belt drive
- Experiment with brushed motors instead of stepper motors
- Use common hardware store H section beam opposed to expensive general purpose construction systems (motedis,system30,openbeam). Will require more complex joins / drilling but at $5/m vs $25/m it is a safe investment.

Revenue
-------
La Trobe University kindly provides a $200 spending budget for final year projects. I will personally fund the remaining fees.

Expenses
--------
The following resources should permit two iterations by recycling most parts.
