Schedule
========

A strict schedule must be kept to ensure successful completion of this project. I have included a buffer month to help cater for unseen problems. If the project is completed before this time I may attempt more of the secondary objectives. A second and third revision might be possible if the iterations are kept on time. A third generation would be ideal as it would represent a well configured device that has been thoroughly tested and improved.
