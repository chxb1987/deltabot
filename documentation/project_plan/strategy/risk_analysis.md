Risk Analysis
=============

Risk mitigation is one of the most important aspects of managing a project. Possible predicted risks should be actively avoided. However not all are are forseen or are avoidable, in such case we should attempt to minimise the impact.

List of risks

List of actions

Action 	| Comment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1	| Diagnose and debug, attempt to develop work around depending on project stage. Redesign if problem is critical.
2	| Adjust Gantt chart, design new tactics and re-prioritise if required.
3	| Obtain new components. If unavailable or time frame does not permit, attempt to use alternative.
4	| Discontinue development on selected components. Adopt complete and tested consumer alternatives.
5	| Pull latest commit from off site Git repository server. Backups should be made nightly.
