FDM accuracy and materials
==========================

Currently, leading consumer 3D printers can produce objects with layers heights of 0.1 millimetres. Such an accurate print will generally take around five hours for a medium sized print. Pricing for a mostly pre-assembled unit is around USD$2,200.

Currently there are two main types of plastics readily available for FDM printing. Firstly Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene or ABS is a strong material. It is a oil based plastic that can be melted and extruded at a temperature of approximately 105Â°C. It is fairly cheap at $40 a Kg. It does contract slightly as it cools.

Polylactic Acid or PLA is another alternative that can be used for FDM printing. It is marginally less expensive then ABS. While being more brittle then ABS it does not contract as much. PLA is a biodegradable polymer and actually is produced by corn starch. Because of it's lower melting point it is not ideal for applications related to heat.
