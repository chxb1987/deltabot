Proposed Solution
=================

The delta machine design has been adopted for this project. Recently the Rostock project has spawned many derivatives, most achieving cheaper construction over the last generation of reprap printers. Delta machines have been used for many applications including; pick and placers, packaging and production line sorters.

Its simplicity helps reduce hardware costs. But the biggest advantage is the machines speed and accuracy. If the central platform is kept light, fast acceleration can be maintained. This permits the machine to perform in a sporadic manner while maintaining an accurate position.

The electronics system will not be a derivative of current implementations. I will experiment with different architectures with the goal of producing a much cheaper but fully capable system. The components will be made modular to allow for a high level of customisation. This helps to keep the main-board costs low but still permits additional more expensive upgrades such as a Ethernet add on.
