Acceleration
============

Acceleration is required to ensure smooth motion is maintained. Smooth motion is essential for reaching high speeds and also to minimise a stepper motor skipping a step. The rate of acceleration can be written as a function of current and next frames momentum.  We are only concerned with the momentum of the actuator carriages, not the momentum of the platform.

## P = mv ##
where #P# is momentum
#m# is mass
#v# is velocity

Once the system has been constructed, we will need to run tests to work out the maximum speed that we should attempt to accelerate to.
