Scale
=====

Scale is a measure of the printed objects size compared to the desired size. It does not necessary represent a large issue as the machine can be calibrated after a single test.

![Scale measured](scale.eps){width=60mm}

The desired print should have been #70.71mm#. Our design needs to be scaled #2.66# to achieve the same size.
