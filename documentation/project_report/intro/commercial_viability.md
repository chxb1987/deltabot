Commercial Viability
====================

This old technology is becoming established in a new market. While it becomes more accessible, new opportunities begin to emerge and intern, increases demand. Prices are decreasing, materials are becoming more accessible and there is an increasing amount of printable designs being uploaded to the Internet. The later attributes the most positive influence to the 3D printing market. This makes an old product more valuable.

It is clear that this market is expanding at a promising rate. Furthermore because there is such a diverse range of neighbouring markets that will benefit from this technology, it is likely that it will be supported by commercial demand alone. Applications for 3D printing have yet to be completely discovered, the boundaries are always being pushed by innovators. It is apparent that a very successful industry has been created.


Commercial Market
-----------------

3D printing can help many different businesses. For example; Product designers can produce prototypes within a few hours, prosthetics can be made for a person more frequently and engineers can produce custom parts easily. It is important to note that even if a 3D printer existed in every home, there are still many skills that can't be replaced by automation. Downloading a generalised product will never replace a professionally crafted custom version. 3D printing just streamlines the development cycle and promotes rapid growth.

Rapid prototyping reduces development costs and creates new opportunities. It is possible that we will see a rise in hardware start-ups similar to the influx of software start-ups we have seen recently. It may be more feasible for a young company to attempt entering into established markets with little overhead.

Consumer Market
---------------

There is a number of reasons why an individual might desire a 3D printer. It may help reduce our consumption rate by allowing us to easily repair broken household items. While it is unlikely for the average person to need a miniature factory, it is ideal for hackers, hobbyists, artists and craftsmen

Currently, the largest consumer market for 3D printing falls inside the open source community. Although intellectual property is freely shared, support and labour is very valuable. These customers are generally open to early adoption of new technology. The network of passionate, diversely skilled customers strive to improve the current designs and collaboratively innovate the CNC scene.
