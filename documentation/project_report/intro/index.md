Introduction
============

3D Printers have received a lot of media attention recently. Additive manufacturing has been around for at least 30 years<cite>1, 2</cite>. However, in the last five years popularity has increased dramatically due to the availability of much cheaper entry level machines. It is now possible for the general public to purchase pre-assembled printers at a similar cost as a personal computer.

There will always be innovation and dangers associated with a new technology. We already have prime examples of both aspects; At a 2011 TED talk, Dr Anthony Atala presented a human kidney prototype that his team had printed<cite>3</cite>. Late 2012 Cody Wilson uploaded a video to Youtube that showed himself firing a gun mostly composed of 3D printed parts<cite>4</cite>.

The environment will benefit from this new way of producing products. Firstly, plastic items can be recycled and reused to create new, more useful items. This not only reduces costs but it also eliminates transportation of new items. They no longer need to be imported and transported all over the country, they can just be downloaded.

Whilst companies like Objet and Stratasys produce printers for the commercial sector, it is hobbyist style printers that have spread awareness of such technology. The Reprap foundation has produced numerous models under the GPL licence. Their main goal is to produce an affordable device that can self replicate. All of the designs are available to download and print. Makerbot Industries is a comercial operation that was born from an open source community.

Online services such as Shapeways provides 3D printing services. This allows their customers to receive a higher quality print without investing in expensive hardware. CAD design community sites have also been very popular such as 'thingiverse.com'. There are over 30,000 free designs including a key-chain fob, mobile phone case, model radial engine and even 3D printer parts and upgrades.
