Two dimensional position in the vertical plane
============================================

Now we are able to examine how we may add a vertical component to the system. From the last sections we discovered that the length required for the vertical actuators is the equal the linkages length. In this example, we have created a square printable area of #(h-2D)^2#. This is possible as the rails are twice the length of the linkages length or #L = 2(h-2D)#.

Introducing the #z# component directly adds to the #a_1# and #a_2# terms. The position equations are amended as:
## a_1(x,z) = \sqrt{ h^2 - (x + D/2 - r)^2 } + z##
## a_2(x,z) = \sqrt{ h^2 - (D/2 - x -r)^2 } + z##
