Vertical travel constraints
===========================

We can also reduce the vertical travel required by reducing the linkages length. This intern reduces the available printing area. However, this can be used to our advantage. For example if we needed to restrict the horizontal bounds so that the platform can't physically interfere with the belt drive that runs alongside the vertical rails.
