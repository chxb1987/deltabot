Structure and Inverse Kinematics 
================================

The hardware design will be in the form of a delta machine. These devices can perform fast accurate tasks as the light-weight print head is capable of quick acceleration. This design has been adopted from a current reprap project cite[5]. The delta machine will use less parts then a traditional Cartesian machine.
