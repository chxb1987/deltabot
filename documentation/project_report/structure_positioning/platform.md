Platform
========

We now need to consider what happens to the linkages when they are offset by the platforms width.

By adding extra length to the horizontal component, we have decreased the horizontal outer bounds of the system. The smaller the platform the more room we are able to travel. It should also be noted that the larger the platform, the less vertical travel is required for the actuators.

The Platform reduces the #b_1# and #b_2# term in our position equation by #r#. We now have:
## a_1(x) = \sqrt{ h^2 - (x + D/2 - r)^2 }##
## a_2(x) = \sqrt{ h^2 - (D/2 - x -r)^2 } ##
