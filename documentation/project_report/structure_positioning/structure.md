Structure
=========

A delta machine consists of a number of kinetic chains that meet at a central platform. This platform can be moved by actuating the pivots connected to the main structure. The platform is kept parallel to the floor during motion. [Figure 2] represents a simple two armed delta machine. The two-dimensional diagram helps to illustrate the important lengths and vectors. After we have analysed a two dimensional machine we will apply these concepts to three-dimensions.

The following assumptions are made to help define the system:
- Platform and linkages must stay within the frame's outer rails.
- Linkages are not restricted in any way, they may swivel on their joins in any direction.
- The platform can not move down past the base.
- Linkages are restricted to the rail's length.
- Linkages can not stretch or contract.
