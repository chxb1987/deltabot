Schedule
========

The original schedule had to be modified in order to accommodate the extra unplanned revisions for both hardware and electronics. From May up until late October, three design iterations of hardware were developed. Each time improving on a major design flaw. Each iteration had a large impact on the schedule, however all were necessary hurdles that contributed to the final product. A second revision of electronics was required after the project goals were re-evaluated and to remove a few bugs.

The additional time added to the timeline pushed some of the key functionality past important dates such as the final presentation. Work has continued after the main delivery dates and a fully functioning 3D printer is estimated to be achieved at the end of January 2014.


An online project log was kept. Posts were made at regular intervals, discussing progress and small milestones. This served as a great resource and helped keep track of ongoing progress. It is available at [http://printer.epidev.com](http://printer.epidev.com).
