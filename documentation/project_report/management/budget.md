Budget
======

There are many consumer 3D printers on the market currently. They range from $450 to over $20,000. One of the primary goals of this project is to produce inexpensive electronics to help reduce the overall cost of 3D printing. $450 is very competitive if the quality is reasonable. The final target cost for this project is a base model for $350 AUD. I have considered many aspects that will help minimise costs:

- low end 8bit AVR ATmega value line microcontrollers
- Single board solution
- Optional components: Flash memory, LCD and Ethernet.
- Minimal hardware
- Printed gears for belt drive
- Balance of cost vs quality for stepper motors
- Use common hardware store smooth and threaded rods

Revenue
-------
La Trobe University kindly provides a $200 spending budget for final year projects. I will personally fund the remaining fees.

Expenses
--------
Most parts were able to be recycled through each design iteration.
