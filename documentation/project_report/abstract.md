This document describes the design and development of an inexpensive 3D printer. The project is developed for the final year engineering project at La Trobe University by Keith Brown.

The printer will be in the form of a delta machine. The intention is to reduce the number of components and utilise cheaper hardware while still achieving a fast accurate print. The electronics will not be a direct derivative of current implementations. Experimentation with alternative architecture will be trialled with the goal of delivering a more computational capable system.

An introduction into 3D Printing and its concepts, advantages and issues is outlined. The commercial viability for both commercial and consumer markets is described. An analysis of both the structure and the systems inverse kinematic equations are included. Considerations regarding fluid motion is outlined. Hardware diagrams and descriptions follow. The electronic and software systems are discussed in detail. Testing procedures and associated results are also examined. Finally, project management tasks are reviewed.
