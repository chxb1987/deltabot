Communication
=============

An FTDI FT220X USB to UART converter is used for communication between the host computer and the printer. It runs at a baud rate of 38400, however burst commands can be sent due the internal FILO buffer included in the integrated circuit. A micro USB header was selected so that common android phone cables can be used.
