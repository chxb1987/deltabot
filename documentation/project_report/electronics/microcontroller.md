Microcontroller
===============

The Microcontroller that has been selected is an Atmel 8-bit ATmega644. It was selected due to its low cost, small footprint and compatibility with existing firmware. The large ATmega family also allows for an upgrade path if required. It can be clocked up to 20MHz however I am using 10AU model which has a maximum of 10Mhz. The 10AU is available in single quantities at $4 compared to the 20Mhz at $11.

The package includes 64 Kbytes of flash memory. It has 44 pins with a total of 32 GPIO available. No USB communication is integrated so a USB to UART chip is required. The physical package selected was a TQFP so that it can be easily soldered with a standard soldering iron.
