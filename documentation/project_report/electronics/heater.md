Heating elements
================

A powerful MOSFET is used to push large current through a small resistor. This produces heat. The heat can be monitored with a robust thermistor. A PID loop will smoothly and accurately maintain a specific temperature. Two heat ports are available; one for the extruder and one a heated bed.
