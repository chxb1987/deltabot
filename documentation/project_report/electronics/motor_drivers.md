Motor Drivers
=============

TI DRV8825 integrated motor drivers were selected to drive the stepper motors. They can be configured to drive a single bipolar stepper motor at 2.5A with up to 1/32 microstepping. They do not require many external passive components. They feature a useful error signal pin that goes high in the event of over current or heating issues. A heat sink should provide adequate heat dissipation.
