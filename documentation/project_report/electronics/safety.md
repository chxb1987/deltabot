Safety
======

A fuse and schottky diode has been added to the power line. It prevents excessive current drawn. This usually occurs when a fault causes a short circuit. As mentioned above, the stepper drivers also have internal thermal fault sensors that cause the chip to shut down until the temperature reaches a reasonable level.
